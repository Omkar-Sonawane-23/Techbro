### **Getting Started**  
This is a **Next.js** project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

To run the development server:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
cd your-repository-folder
```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Run the Development Server**  
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Open the Application**  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### **Remarks**  
- The system is designed with scalability in mind and can be easily adapted for use by other institutions.
- With **Next.js**, the application benefits from **server-side rendering** (SSR) for better performance and SEO optimization.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is implemented to enhance security, ensuring that users have appropriate permissions based on their role.
- **Vercel** was chosen for seamless deployment, enabling fast and efficient continuous integration.
